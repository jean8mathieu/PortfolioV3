        <p>My name is Jean-Mathieu Emond and I am fron Quebec city. Since 2014, I've been working on multiple projects
        that people always been enjoying to use. I always try to make my code as efficient as possible and bug free.
        My expertise is working on backend code using Laravel. I've also wrote some autonomous script that was doing
            task for me in a game. I've also wrote multiple script while I was working for
            <a href="https://www.benevity.com/" target="_blank">Benevity</a> for repetitive task or as an example
            translating a Excel file into a SQL file that will than get inserted in a database. Or using an excel file
            to quickly generate a translated version of the text. Or get a postal code and return the LONG and LAT.</p>

        <p>I've been working on multiple company since I graduated from
            <a href="https://www.sheridancollege.ca/" target="_blank">Sheridan College</a>. My first job was at Bell
            mostly working on a HR system that would deal with people applying to our department. After that I joined
            Benevity to deal with the technical aspect of managing the client grants website. After that I decided to
            move back in Quebec to Montreal. As soon as I moved in Montreal. I started working for a company called
            <a href="https://myevent.com/">My Event</a>. My main task over there was to rewrite their old feature into
            their brand new platform code. After that I decided that I needed something more challenging and joined
            <a href="https://www.simplyphp.com/" target="_blank">SimplyPHP</a>.
        </p>

        <p>When I am not working I'm mostly working on personal project or volunteering for
            <a href="https://truckersmp.com/" target="_blank">TruckersMP</a> where I develop the website for millions of
            people to use.</p>
